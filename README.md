# Data Fusion Assignment

We implemented 6 approaches:

### High-Level Fusion
- Randomly initialized CNN (section 3.1.1. in the report)
- Pre-trained CNN (section 3.1.2. in the report)
### Mid-Level Fusion
- Randomly initialized CNN (section 3.2.1. in the report)
- Local Binary Pattern + kNN (section 3.2.2. in the report)
- Multiple Methods ï¼ˆORB, BRISK, and SIFT) + SVC (section 3.2.3. in the report)
### Federated Learning
- Horizontal FL + CNN (section 3.3 in the report)


To find how we solved the _**bonus task**_ (Cohen's Kappa method), see report section 2.2.
